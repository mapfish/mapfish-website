MapFish
*******

MapFish is a flexible and complete framework for building rich web-mapping
applications.

MapFish aims to provide tools for creating well-structured applications and
web services, freeing developers from repeated tasks and making them
productive.

MapFish is based on the `Pylons <http://pylonshq.com>`_ Python web framework.
MapFish provides what Pylons provides, plus specific, geospatial-oriented
commands and programming interfaces of its own. Applications created with
MapFish are structured in the same way as applications created with Pylons;
in particular, they follow the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern.

Not only does the MapFish framework organize the server side code of the
application, it also organizes the client side code, installing a complete
JavaScript toolbox in the application, setting up the JavaScript testing
environment, and tools for compressing the JavaScript code.

The JavaScript toolbox is composed of the `Ext <http://extjs.com>`_,
`OpenLayers <http://www.openlayers.org>`_ , `GeoExt <http://www.geoext.org>`_
JavaScript toolkits, and specific MapFish components for interacting with
MapFish web services.
