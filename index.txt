MapFish
*******

MapFish is a flexible and complete framework for building rich web-mapping
applications. It emphasizes high productivity, and high-quality development. 

MapFish is based on the `Pylons <http://pylonshq.com>`_ Python web framework.
MapFish provides what Pylons provides, plus specific commands and programming
interfaces.

MapFish also provides a complete RIA-oriented JavaScript toolbox, a JavaScript
testing environment, and tools for compressing JavaScript code. The JavaScript
toolbox is composed of the `Ext <http://extjs.com>`_, `OpenLayers
<http://www.openlayers.org>`_ , `GeoExt <http://www.geoext.org>`_ JavaScript
toolkits, and specific components for interacting with MapFish web services.

MapFish is open source, and distributed under the `GPLv3
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html>`_ license.

**Interoperability**

The MapFish framework is built around an open HTTP-based protocol, allowing
various interoperable implementations. In addition to the reference
implementation provided by the Python/Pylons-based framework, two other implementations are
currently available:

* a Ruby/Rails plugin
* a PHP/Symfony plugin

See the documentation for more information.
