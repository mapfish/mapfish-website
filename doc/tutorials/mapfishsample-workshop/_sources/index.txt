MapFish In Production Workshop
==============================

This document provides the written material of the "MapFish In Production"
workshop, held at the `FOSS4G 2011 Conference <http://2011.foss4g.org/>`_.

This workshop is a practical introduction to developing production-level
MapFish applications. The practises presented in this workshop aren't the only
way to develop MapFish applications, they just represent what we, at Camptocamp,
use, and consider good practises, for our customer projects.

In this workshop the official MapFish demo application, *MapFishSample*, is
studied. Thus, this document provides a tutorial on how to use MapFish
in production, as well as a guide to the MapFishSample application.

The workshop is organized in several modules:
