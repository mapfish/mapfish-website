Getting Started
***************

In this module you're going to spend a few minutes setting up your working
environment for this workshop.

.. note::

    If you aren't following this document as a workshop attendee and want to
    use your own system, as opposed to the Debian virtual machine provided for
    the workshop, you can skip this module.

Start the virtual machine
=========================

The Debian GNU/Linux operating system will be used. It will be executed in
a VirtualBox virtual machine. To start the Debian operating system open
VirtualBox and start the system named ``mapfish_workshop``.

.. note::

    If there's no system named ``mapfish_workshop`` you will have to create one
    in VirtualBox, using the ``mapfish_workshop.vdi`` file as the Hard Disk.

Use ``user`` as the username and password to log into the system.

.. note::

    The VM is downloadable at http://www.mapfish.org/downloads/mapfish_workshop.vdi.bz2.

Open the documentation
======================

This document is available in the Debian system in HTML form. To view it launch
the *Iceweasel* web browser and open http://mapfish/mapfish_workshop. Iceweasel
should be available from the desktop's top panel.

.. note::

    `Iceweasel <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceweasel>`_ is Mozilla FireFox
    rebranded by Debian.

Create a directory for the workshop
===================================

It is recommended to create a directory named ``mapfish_workshop``, which will
be your working directory for this workshop.

For that, open a terminal, create a directory named ``mapfish_workshop``,
and change to it::

    $ mkdir mapfish_workshop
    $ cd mapfish_workshop


Miscellaneous notes
===================

PostgreSQL will be used in this workshop. PostgreSQL should be up and running
in the virtual machine. You can use ``pgAdmin`` to connect to PostgreSQL, which
should be available from the desktop's top panel.

To edit files you can use any editor of your choice. The ``gedit`` editor
should be available from the desktop's top panel.
