Studio - User Guide (BETA)
==========================

This document contains instructions for end users of Studio.

Introduction
------------

Studio is a web software used to administrate web mapping applications based on `MapFish <http://www.mapfish.org>`_ framework.
Studio allows the web administrator to manage the geodata, to stylize them with a wysiwyg MapFile editor (for `MapServer <http://www.mapserver.org>`_) and to create a custom web mapping applications.

Install Studio
--------------

Install
^^^^^^^

Currently, use :ref:`studio_developer_guide` for installation.

Work with Studio
----------------

Three Studio components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Studio UI is divided in three functional parts:

* Data: for the management of data stored as file or in a PostGis database
* MapFile: for the easy creation of MapFile and the definition of WMS / WFS services in MapServer
* MapFish: for the creation and publication of MapFish website

.. image:: _static/studio_full_view.png

Work with Data manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Per default, two directories are configured:

* PostGis datastore: allow the user to store spatial data in a PostGis database
* Directory datastore: alow the user to use data as geospatial files (supported format: ESRI shapefile and raster georeferenced files)

How to import shapefiles in Studio ?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

    The procedure is the following::

        Select the "default (directory)" datastore
        Choose "Add a new datasource..." function
        Browse your filesystem to select a zip file containing the shapefile files (.shp, .dbf, .shx and .prj at least)
        and your file are uploaded to the server

How to load shapefile in Studio PostGis database ?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

    The procedure is the following::

        Select the "default (postgis)" datastore
        Choose "Add a new datasource..." function
        Browse your filesystem to select a zip file containing the shapefile files (.shp, .dbf, .shx and .prj at least)
        and your file are uploaded to the server and stored in the database

**Hint**

   ``Don't forget the prj file that contain the coordinate system information.``

Work with MapFile manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MapFile manager has two main goals:

* Create a MapFile with a wysiwyg editor
* Generate WMS / WFS webservice that can be used in a Spatial Data Infrastructure

How to create a new MapFile ?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

    The procedure is the following::

        Click on the "Create new mapfile..." function
        Select the "Global properties panel"
        Define a name for the mapfile
        Define a Projection (for example "+init=epsg:2154" for RGF_1993_Lambert_93 or "+init=epsg:21781" for CH1903_LV03)
        Define the image color (background color)
        And the extent of interest

**Hint**

   ``The MapFile properties are very well documented here:`` http://www.mapserver.org/mapfile/index.html#mapfile

**Hint**

   ``Use ACII characters for MapFile name.``

**Hint**

   ``Always click on "Save mapfile" to observe the result of your modifications.``

How to create a new layer in the MapFile ?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

    The procedure is the following::

        Click on the "Create new layer..." function
        Choose a datastore (per default: "default (directory)" or "default (postgis)").
        You find then in the data source list the data you imported previously and the sample data provided with Studio. Select one dataset.
        Then you should see the data in the map viewer

.. image:: _static/studio_mapfile_add_layer.png

**Hint**

   ``All the layers of a MapFile have to have different names, otherwise MapServer can't recognize them and will not be able to create maps.``

**Hint**

   ``Use ACII characters for layer name.``

How to classify data based on attribute values ?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

    The procedure is the following::

        Hover the desired layer and click on the "Classifiy using wizard" icon on the right.
        Follow the classification wizard: select an attribute, select the classification process (quantile or unique value), define symbology...
        ... and click on classify. Studio will generate the classes.
        Save the MapFile and you can see the result in the map preview

.. image:: _static/studio_mapfile_classification_wizard.png

**Hint**

   ``Don't forget to "Save mapfile" to see the result of the classification.``

How to define advanced class symbology ?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

    The procedure is the following::

        Select a class
        You have the possibility to modify existing style or to add new style (like fill or stroke, buttons on the bottom)

.. image:: _static/studio_mapfile_class_editor.png

Work with MapFish manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MapFish allows the creation and publication of MapFish websites.

Several steps are necessary to publish a complete web mapping applications:

1. Create a new MapFish and set the global properties
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. image:: _static/studio_mapfish_global_properties.png

**Hint**

   ``You can add html tags in the header section. If it's empty, no header will appear.``

**Hint**

   ``The coordinate system information (EPSG code) can't be modified afterwards, because Studio check the validity of the added layers.`` 

**Hint**

   ``The initial extent of your map has to be defined here``

2. Configure layers
"""""""""""""""""""

.. image:: _static/studio_mapfish_layers_editor.png

**Hint**

   ``A layer from an existing MapFile or from a WMS server can be chosen. Instead of using one of the proposed WMS, you can type your own URL.``

**Hint**

   ``You need at least to define one base layer.``

3. Configure datasource
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Three capabilities can be configured:

  * The layer and attributes to be edit
  * The layer and attributes to be shown in a tooltip
  * The layer and attributes to be queryied

.. image:: _static/studio_mapfish_configure_datasource.png

**Hint**

   ``Only the data stored in a PostGis database can be configured.``

4. Configure print
""""""""""""""""""

.. image:: _static/studio_mapfish_configure_print.png

5. Start server
"""""""""""""""

Start the server ...

**Hint**

   ``Wait some seconds before clicking on "Start server". Studio needs to prepare all the file structure ;-)``

**Hint**

   ``Every website works on its own port.``

6. See the published MapFish
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

... and see the published MapFish website

.. image:: _static/studio_mapfish_published_website.png

**Hint**

   ``The tooltips are available only when the tooltip accordion is open``


**Hint**

   ``The created site is based on a template. This template can be adapted to your needs (but this part has to be in the developer guide;-)``
