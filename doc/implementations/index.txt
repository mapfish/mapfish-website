Implementations
***************

The MapFish framework is built around an open HTTP-based protocol, allowing
various interoperable implementations. In addition to the reference
implementation provided by the Python framework, two other implementations are
currently available:

* a PHP/Symfony plugin
* a Ruby/Rails plugin


Symfony plugin
--------------

A PHP implementation of the MapFish Protocol is available as a plugin to the
`Symfony framework <http://www.symfony-project.org/>`_. The plugin offers tools
for generating MapFish applications and web services, it relies on the
`Doctrine ORM <http://www.doctrine-project.org/>`_. It is distributed under
the terms of the BSD license.

The `plugin <http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfMapFishPlugin>`_ is
hosted by the Symfony project. The `README <http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfMapFishPlugin?tab=plugin_readme>`_ is also hosted by the Symfony project.

Rails plugin
------------

A Ruby implementation of the MapFish Protocol is available as a plugin to
the `Ruby on Rails framework <http://rubyonrails.org/>`_. The plugin offers
tools for generating MapFish applications and web services. 

This plugin is available in the ``implementations`` directory of the MapFish
SVN, under the terms of the GPLv3 license.
