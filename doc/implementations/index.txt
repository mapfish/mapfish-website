Implementations
***************

The MapFish framework is built around an open HTTP-based protocol, allowing
various interoperable implementations. In addition to the reference
implementation provided by the Python framework, two other implementations are
currently available:

* a Ruby/Rails plugin
* a PHP/Symfony plugin

Symfony plugin
--------------

A PHP implementation of the MapFish Protocol is available as a plugin to the
`Symfony framework <http://www.symfony-project.org/>`_. The plugin offers tools
for generating MapFish applications and web services, it relies on the
`Doctrine ORM <http://www.doctrine-project.org/>`_.

The `plugin <http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfMapFishPlugin>`_ is
hosted by the Symfony project.
