Installation
************

Installing system dependencies
------------------------------

On Unix, Python version 2.5 or 2.6 and the Python development files must be
installed.

.. note::
    On Debian-based systems one can use ``apt-get install python2.5
    python2.5-dev`` to install Python 2.5 and its development files.
    Geos and Posgres/Postgis are also required:  ``sudo apt-get install libpq-dev libgeos-dev postgresql postgis``

On Windows `Python 2.5 <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5.4/>`_, and
the `Python for Windows extensions <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/>`_
must be installed.

For Windows, we assume in the rest of this page that Python 2.5 is installed in
``C:\Python25``.

Installing MapFish
------------------

To install MapFish, `download <http://www.mapfish.org/downloads/go-mapfish-framework-1.2.py>`_ the installation script, and execute it from a terminal.

On a Unix system::

    $ python go-mapfish-framework-1.2.py --no-site-packages env

On a Windows system::

    C:\> C:\Python25\python.exe go-mapfish-framework-1.2.py --no-site-packages env

This command creates a virtual Python environment named ``env`` and installs
MapFish and its dependencies into it.

.. note::
    The so-called `go` script actually installs two Python eggs for MapFish:

     - the egg ``mapfish`` for the server framework
     - the egg ``mapfish.plugin.client`` for the Javascript toolbox

Now activate the virtual environment.

On a Unix system::

    $ source env/bin/activate

On a Windows system::

    C:\> env\Scripts\activate.bat

You command prompt should now look like this::

    (env) $

To check that MapFish is correctly installed, enter::

    (env) $ paster create --list-templates

and check that the output is::

    Available templates:
    basic_package:   A basic setuptools-enabled package
    mapfish:         MapFish application template
    mapfish_client:  MapFish client plugin template
    paste_deploy:    A web application deployed through paste.deploy
    pylons:          Pylons application template
    pylons_minimal:  Pylons minimal application template

MapFish is installed, congratulations!
